Assuming that there are three different processors, Proc1, Proc2 and Proc3 for the same instruction set, Proc1 has a CPI of 2.5 with 4 GHz clock rate, a CPI of 2.0 with 3 GHz clock rate in Proc2, and a CPI of 2.1 with 3.8 GHz clock rate in Proc3.
a.	Which processor has the highest performance for the instructions per second? 
b.	If each processor executes a program in 12 seconds, what is the number of cycles and the number of instructions respectively?
c.	When reducing the execution time by 25% but this leads to an increase of 22% in the CPI, what clock rate should have for the time reduction?
